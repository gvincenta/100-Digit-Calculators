Welcome to my 100 digit calculators!
This was one of my assignments from COMP10002 - Foundations of Algorithms
The calculator stores each digit punched in as an array of integers.
It is able to support addition, multiplication, and powers.
The calculator is able to support up to 100 digits of integer calculations.
The calculator removes any leading zeros and it also truncates anything after 100 digits.
For more info, please read the specs.
 
Feel free to use for the sake of extended precisions!

Cheers,
